# CART

- This is an example of a classification tree.
- I use the [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/rpart.pdf) package in R. 
- You need the "biblioCART.bib" in your working directory to compile the Rmd file.
- the "biblioCART.bib" stores the references. If not familiar with Bibtex, just delete the "bibliography: biblioCART.bib"" 
from the Rmd preamble (9th line) - it compiles without the citations and refs you can always check the references from the pdf file
